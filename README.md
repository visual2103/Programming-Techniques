<h1 align="center">Project Overview</h1>

<h2 align="center">1.Polynomial Calculator</h2>

<p align="center">
The Polynomial Calculator enables polynomial manipulation and operations through a graphical interface. Users can input polynomials, select operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivative, integration), and view results.
</p>

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>GUI: Built with Java Swing or JavaFX</li>
  <li>Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, derivative, and integration/li>
  <li>Design: Object-oriented with classes like Polynomial and Monomial; uses Map for polynomial modeling</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">2.Queue Management Simulation</h2>

<p align="center">
The Queues Management Application efficiently assigns clients to queues to minimize their waiting times. This application simulates client arrivals, queue management, and service processing using threads and synchronization mechanisms.
</p>

<h3>Features:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Queue Management:</strong> Manages multiple queues to serve clients based on arrival and service times.</li>
  <li><strong>Multithreading:</strong> Uses threads to handle each queue and manage client processing in parallel.</li>
  <li><strong>Synchronization:</strong> Employs synchronized data structures to ensure thread safety.</li>
  <li><strong>Simulation:</strong> Simulates client arrivals and queue processing over a defined time period.</li>
  <li><strong>Logging:</strong> Tracks and displays the status of waiting clients and queues throughout the simulation.</li>
  <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Provides a graphical user interface for simulation setup and real-time queue status display.</li>
</ul>

<h2 align="center">3.Orders Management Application</h2>

<p align="center">
The Orders Management Application has been successfully built using object-oriented design principles and a layered architecture, adhering to Java naming conventions. The application includes:
</p>

<h3>Components:</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>GUI:</strong> Interfaces for managing clients, products, and orders, with functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting entries, as well as handling stock and creating orders.</li>
  <li><strong>Database:</strong> A relational database with tables for clients, products, and orders.</li>
  <li><strong>Reflection Techniques:</strong> Dynamic database operations and table header generation using reflection.</li>
  <li><strong>Immutable Class:</strong> A <code>Bill</code> class defined using Java records for logging purposes, ensuring that bills are only inserted and read from the Log table.</li>
</ul>
