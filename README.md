#Project Overview

##Polynomial Calculator

The Polynomial Calculator is designed for effective polynomial manipulation and mathematical operations. Key challenges included implementing correct algorithms and performing rigorous testing to ensure accuracy. Future enhancements could focus on:

Advanced GUI features for improved user interaction.
Support for polynomials with complex coefficients.
Capabilities for saving and loading polynomial data.

##Queue Management Simulation

The Queues Management Application efficiently assigns clients to queues to minimize their waiting times. This application simulates client arrivals, queue management, and service processing using threads and synchronization mechanisms.

Features

Queue Management: Manages multiple queues to serve clients based on arrival and service times.
Multithreading: Uses threads to handle each queue and manage client processing in parallel.
Synchronization: Employs synchronized data structures to ensure thread safety.
Simulation: Simulates client arrivals and queue processing over a defined time period.
Logging: Tracks and displays the status of waiting clients and queues throughout the simulation.
User Interface: Provides a graphical user interface for simulation setup and real-time queue status display.

##Orders Management Application

The Orders Management application has been successfully built using object-oriented design principles and a layered architecture, adhering to Java naming conventions. The application includes:

GUI: Interfaces for managing clients, products, and orders, with functionalities for adding, editing, and deleting entries, as well as handling stock and creating orders.
Database: A relational database with tables for clients, products, and orders.
Reflection Techniques: Dynamic database operations and table header generation using reflection.
Immutable Class: A Bill class defined using Java records for logging purposes, ensuring that bills are only inserted and read from the Log table.
